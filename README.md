## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **systems-focused cybersecurity engineer in training**, deeply interested in how software behaves under real-world constraints — memory, execution flow, privilege boundaries, and failure states.

I work close to the system:

- Linux internals  
- Cryptographic design & implementation  
- Secure file systems and communication models  
- Low-level debugging and reverse reasoning  

My goal isn’t surface-level security —  
it’s **understanding systems deeply enough to break and harden them properly**.

## 🔐 Current Focus

- File encryption & secure storage systems (AES, key handling)
- Linux-based security experimentation (Kali, Termux, CLI tooling)
- Networking fundamentals & secure communication models
- OS-level concepts: permissions, processes, isolation
- Building tools instead of solving CTFs endlessly

---

- C
- Python
- Bash

**Core Domains**
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
- Cryptography (implementation-focused)
- Linux & system internals

## 🔥 Featured Projects

### 🔐 File Encryption & Decryption Tool (AES)
A secure file protection system built in Java with focus on:

- Proper key handling
- Encryption/decryption integrity
- GUI-based usability
- Real-world threat modeling (not just academic AES usage)

➡️ Focused on understanding *why* encryption fails in real implementations.

### 🌍 STLF – Load Forecasting System
Time-series forecasting project focused on:

- System reliability
- Infrastructure stress prediction
- Decision-support modeling

Used as an engineering problem — not just ML output generation.
